    <h3>Hi! I am Amanda. Welcome to my page.</h3>
    <p>
      <span>I am a physical therapist</span> with ten years of experience. For the last year and a half, I have been treating via telahealth. While most of my work is done via the computer, my patients use an app on their end. This is what really got me interested in UX design. I grew up and went to college in Pennsylvania. My husband and I have moved around a lot, from east coast to west coast, most recently living in Austin, TX. I love to hike, travel, and eat (although travel and eating out have taken a bit of a backseat due to covid). I don't really have a favorite place I've ever been to, but I always recommend people travel to Argentina. Patagonia is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I am using a MacBook Pro.
