    <h3>Hi! I am Amanda. Welcome to my page.</h3>
    <p>
      I am taking this course as part of the UCLAx UX Design Certificate Program. I am a physical therapist with ten years of experience. For the last year and a half, I have been treating via telahealth. While most of my work is done using the computer, my patients use an app on their end. This is what really got me interested in UX design. I grew up and went to college and grad school in Pennsylvania. My husband and I have moved around a lot, from east coast to west coast, most recently living in Austin, TX. I love to hike, travel, and eat (although travel and visiting restaurants have taken a bit of a backseat due to Covid19). I don't really have a favorite place I've ever been to, but I always recommend people travel to Argentina. Patagonia is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I am using a MacBook Pro.
    </p>
    <p> I've never done any type of coding before, and I have an irrational fear of somehow messing my computer up badly with using the terminal (I know this is a confidence issue- should get better as I get more comfortable). I had some trouble with git when I accidentally pulled instead of pushed, and at some point, I accidentally cloned a file. Google has been very helpful.
